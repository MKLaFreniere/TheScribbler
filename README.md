A little word game created in summer of 2020 to practice and maintain what I
learned in my first coding class. I wanted to flex my newfound knowledge so 
it incorporates almost everything I learned in the class. With this you can 
unscramble words or play hangman. If playing singleplayer, it requires a .txt
file like Default.txt
